**Learning:** `transition-all` triggers heavy CPU reflow and layout-thrashing on every frame, and animating properties like `width` causes layout invalidation.
**Action:** Replaced `transition-all` with `transition-colors` in FilterBar and page ops. Replaced `width` animations in `NewsSentiment` and `PatternScanner` horizontal progress bars with `transform: scaleX(...)` and `transformOrigin: left` to ensure pure composite-layer animation running on GPU.
